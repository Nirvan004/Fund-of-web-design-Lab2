NOTE: the qr code and the blog posts are 2 seperate branches as I couldnt figure out if I could put both html and css files on the same branch
After completing these challenges, take a few minutes to answer the following questions:

How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

1. Figma helped with sizing and spacing the things on the page as well as exact colors and descriptions for what the text should be
2. challenges I faced were mostly default values pushing things off the page and having to figure out what those default values were and what I needed to add into the css file
3. these challenges are really simple but offer a lot of different ways of solving the same problem so you might be able to find a more streamlined and easier way of solving the same problems by going though the community feedback and posts.
